  abstract = {A probabilistic method is presented which cryptanalyzes any N key cryptosystem in N^2/3 operations with N^2/3 words of memory (average valeus) after a precomputation which requires N operations. If the precomputation can be performed in a reasonable time period (e.g* several years), the additional computation reqoired to recover each key compares very favorably with the N operations requred by an exhaustive search and the N words of memory reqoircd by table lookup. When applied to the Data Encryption Standard (DES) used in block mode, it indicates that solution should cost between $1 and $100 each. The method works in a chosen plain text attack and, if cipher block chaining is not used, can also be used in a ciphertext-only attack.}

  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

  abstract = {Time/memory tradeoff (TMTO) is a generic method of inverting oneway functions. In this paper, we focus on identifying candidate oneway functions hidden in cryptographic algorithms, inverting which will result in breaking the algorithm. The results we obtain on stream and block ciphers are the most important ones. For streamciphers using IV, we show that if the IV is shorter than the key, then the algorithm is vulnerable to TMTO. Further, from a TMTO point of view, it makes no sense to increase the size of the internal state of a streamcipher without increasing the size of the IV. This has impact on the recent ECRYPT call for streamcipher primitives and clears an almost decade old confusion on the size of key versus state of a streamcipher. For blockciphers, we consider various modes of operations and show that to different degrees all of these are vulnerable to TMTO attacks. In particular, we describe multiple data chosen plaintext TMTO attacks on the CBC and CFB modes of operations. This clears a quarter century old confusion on this issue starting from Hellman's seminal paper in 1980 to Shamir's invited talk at Asiacrypt 2004. We also provide some new applications of TMTO and a set of general guidelines for applying TMTO attacks.},

  abstract = {In 1980 Hellman introduced a general technique for breaking arbitrary block ciphers with N possible keys in time T and memory M related by the tradeoff curve TM2 = N2 for 1 ≤ T ≤ N. Recently, Babbage and Golic pointed out that a different TM = N tradeoff attack for 1 ≤ T ≤ D is applicable to stream ciphers, where D is the amount of output data available to the attacker. In this paper we show that a combination of the two approaches has an improved time/memory/data tradeoff for stream ciphers of the form TM2D2 = N2 for any D2 ≤ T ≤ N. In addition, we show that stream ciphers with low sampling resistance have tradeoff attacks with fewer table lookups and a wider choice of parameters.},

  abstract = {In 1980 Martin Hellman described a cryptanalytic time-memory trade-off which reduces the time of cryptanalysis by using precalculated data stored in memory. This technique was improved by Rivest before 1982 with the introduction of distinguished points which drastically reduces the number of memory lookups during cryptanalysis. This improved technique has been studied extensively but no new optimisations have been published ever since. We propose a new way of precalculating the data which reduces by two the number of calculations needed during cryptanalysis. Moreover, since the method does not make use of distinguished points, it reduces the overhead due to the variable chain length, which again significantly reduces the number of calculations. As an example we have implemented an attack on MS-Windows password hashes. Using 1.4GB of data (two CD-ROMs) we can crack 99.9{\%} of all alphanumerical passwords hashes (237) in 13.6 seconds whereas it takes 101 seconds with the current approach using distinguished points. We show that the gain could be even much higher depending on the parameters used.},

This procedure is well known but did not lead to realistic implementations. This paper considers a cryptanalytic time-memory tradeoff using distinguished points, a method referenced to Rivest. The algorithm proposed decreases the expected number of memory accesses with sensible modifications of the other parameters and allows much more realistic implementations of fast key search machines. We present a detailed analysis of the algorithm and solve theoretical open problems of previous models. We also propose efficient mask functions in terms of hardware cost and probability of success. These results were experimentally confirmed and we used a purpose-built FPGA design to perform realistic tradeoffs against DES. The resulting online attack is feasible on a single PC and we recover a 40-bit key in about 10 seconds.},

Those lookup tables offer an almost optimal time-memory tradeoff in the process of recovering the plaintext password from a password hash, generated by a cryptographic hash function. In this paper, the first known such generic system is demonstrated. It is implemented in a state-of-the-art reconfigurable device that cracks passwords, which are encrypted with a number of different cryptographic algorithms. The proposed FPGA-based system is up to 1000 times faster than the corresponding software approach. This is achieved by using a highly parallel architecture employing a fine-grained pipeline.},

Time Memory Trade Off attack is one of the methods that inverts a one way function. The resistance to TMTO attacks is an important criterion in the design of a modern cipher. Unlike the exhaustive search and table lookup methods, TMTO is a probabilistic method, that is, the search operation may not find a preimage even if there exists one. Up to now, there are some approximate bounds for success rates of Hellman table by Hellman and Kusuda et al. In this study, we give a more precise approximation for the coverage of a single Hellman table. There is no precise guideline in the literature that points out how to choose parameters for Hellman TMTO. We present a detailed analysis of the success rate of Hellman table via new parameters and also show how to choose parameters to achieve a higher success rate. The results are experimentally confirmed. We also discuss the Hellman's TMTO Curve.},
